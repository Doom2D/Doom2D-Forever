# About
A recreation of the classic [Doom2D](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_2D) game from the late DOS era, a simulacrum of a parody - just as it should be.

This open-source, multiplatform project has been developed from the ground up to recreate the original game while significantly enhancing gameplay, graphics, and introducing several new gamemodes. It features support for high-resolution graphics, improved AI, numerous fixes, and most importantly **online multiplayer**, revitalizing one of the biggest cult classics of ex-USSR.

## Requirements
For any possible build of Doom2D Forever you will need:

- FPC >= 3.1.1
- libenet >= 1.3.13

## Build

Please follow the instructions below to be able to build the project from source:

Clone the project, and change your current working directory to project root.

Create the `tmp` and `bin` directories and then run:

```shell
  cd src/game
  fpc -O1 -g -gl -dDISABLE_SOUND -dUSE_SYSTUB -dUSE_GLSTUB -FE../../bin -FU../../tmp Doom2DF.lpr
```

If that command succeeds, you have a working FPC and libenet installation.
