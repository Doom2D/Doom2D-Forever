@h1 NAME
Custom configuration manual for a Doom2D Forever dedicated server.


@h1 CONTENTS

1. Server setitngs

2. Game parameters

3. Events

4. Aliases

@h1 1. Server settings
The dedicated server uses its own configuration file, which is set up only with a text editor. It is not enough to simply change something in the main game and then copy it from its .cfg file into the server file - in the menu "Custom Game" not all settings for the server are displayed, and some variables from there you can not change. In this paragraph, we consider the most necessary parameters that must be prescribed.


@h2 Main options
sv_name "<name>"
	Server name.

sv_passwd "<password>"
	Lock server with password.

sv_port PORTNUMBER
	The port number to be used by the server, by default it is recommended 25667. Overwritten by the parameter -port.

sv_public 1/0
	Whether to show the server in the list or not, by default it is shown.

sv_maxplrs <number>
	Maximum number of slots for players. Recommended 14-16.

sv_intertime <number>
	After how many seconds the server will start the next round. For non-cooperative servers it is recommended to set -1 (this will set the timer for 15 seconds).


@h2 Administration option
sv_rcon 1/0
	Enable rcon access to manage the server.

sv_rcon_password
	Password for rcon, specify without spaces and quotes.

@h2 Ban options
sv_autoban_threshold <number>
	After how many attempts to harm the server player should be banned (0 = off), default is 5.
sv_autoban_permanent 1/0
	Set the permanence of the ban (0 = ban for a while), default is 1.
sv_autoban_warn 1/0
	Warn the client about penalty triggers, default is 0.
sv_auth_timeout <number>
	Time (in milliseconds) for the client to complete authentication to the server (0 = infinite), default is 30 seconds.
sv_packet_timeout <number>
	Time (in milliseconds) the client has to idle before being kicked (0 = infinite), default is 60 seconds.

@h2 Optional options
sv_forwardports 1/0
	Does the server have to pierce the ports itself through miniupnpc.
sv_reliable_interval <number>
	Delay between objects position sending at reliable channel. Must be greater than sv_update_interval.
sv_update_interval <number>
	Delay between objects position sending at unreliable channel.
sv_master_interval <number>
	After how many seconds the server has to remind the master server.


@h2 Technical options
net_master_list <host>
	To which master server address the data will be sent. You can specify more than one, for example dfms.doom2d.org:25665,dfms2.doom2d.org:1005
rdl_ignore_enabled 1/0
	Enable or disable hash checking.
rdl_ignore_names <resource wad names>
	The names of the resource files (from the wads folder without an extension) that should not be checked by the server for consistency.
rdl_hashdb_save_enabled 1/0
	Saving hashes in the database on disk.

@h1 2. Game parameters
Game parameters are not required to be specified in the maplist, and serve rather to override the configuration file settings, so as not to change the values in it unnecessarily. To turn on you must set 1, to turn off - 0.

g_gamemode dm/tdm/ctf/coop

	Should bots fight players


@h2 Limits

@h2 Time settings
g_item_respawn_time <number>
	How much time (in seconds) should appear items, the default is 60.
g_warmup_time <number>
	Warmup time for Survival mode and its derivatives, in seconds.


@h2 Spawn
g_spawn_invul <number>

g_team_absorb_attacks 1/0
	Enable or disable the absorption of some damage by allies when bullets pass through them.

@h1 3. Events
To control certain events on the server, there is a command event, through which you can relatively flexibly configure the behavior of the server in certain situations. The need to use the event command is directly related to proper server startup and map lists.@br
The command supports the following types of events:

onmapstart
	Execute the given commands at the start of the next map.
onmapend
	Execute the given commands at the end of the map.
oninter
	Perform assigned commands at the end of the round (when the points table appears).
onwadend
	Execute the given commands at the end of the megawad/campaing (after passing the last level).

Note: parameters may not work as expected, so it is recommended to use the examples below to ensure that aliases work.

@h1 4. Aliases
After defining all the parameters, it is necessary to configure the aliases. Through them set lists of maps, switching multiple parameters simultaneously, the implementation of multiple modes on the server with the correct settings for each, etc. If you plan to keep the server on a regular basis, then it is imperative that you set a list of maps on the server. This paragraph will specify working examples that you can use in your configuration file for the server.

Change gamemode to DM with its inherent settings, notify the players about it, as well as set the map directly:

	@pre
	alias dm "g_gamemode dm;g_warmup_time 16;g_maxlives 0;g_dm_keys 1;g_timelimit 900;g_scorelimit 0;sv_intertime -1;centerprint 100 GAMEMODE: DM;nextmap PrikolSoft.wad MAP01;event onmapend call cmap02;bot_removeall"
	@endpre

Change gamemode to coop (with the ability to pass bullets through players)::

	@pre
	alias coop "g_gamemode coop;g_maxlives 0;g_dm_keys 0;g_timelimit 0;g_scorelimit 0;sv_intertime 30;g_team_hit_trace 0;centerprint 100 GAMEMODE: Cooperative;call coop01;bot_removeall"
	@endpre

Change gamemode to coop (classic):

	@pre
	alias coop "g_gamemode coop;g_maxlives 0;g_dm_keys 0;g_timelimit 0;g_scorelimit 0;sv_intertime 30;g_team_hit_trace 1;centerprint 100 GAMEMODE: Cooperative;call coop01;bot_removeall"
	@endpre

Change gamemode to survival:

	@pre
	alias survival "g_gamemode coop;g_warmup_time 60;g_maxlives 1;g_dm_keys 1;g_timelimit 0;g_scorelimit 0;g_team_hit_trace 0;g_weaponstay 1;g_friendlyfire 0;sv_intertime 30;centerprint 100 GAMEMODE: Survival;call coop01;bot_removeall"
	@endpre

By the same example, you can set and batch switching of parameters during the game, just list in the alias needed to change the parameters.

Set a list of maps that will be used on the server (it must be looped!):

	@pre
	alias cmap01 "event onmapstart nextmap PrikolSoft.wad MAP01;       event onmapend call cmap02"
	alias cmap02 "event onmapstart nextmap SurMP.wad MAP01;       event onmapend call cmap03"
	alias cmap03 "event onmapstart nextmap PrikolSoft.wad MAP01;     event onmapend call cmap01"
	@endpre

Set up some list of megawads (it must be looped!):

	@pre
	# Set wads
	alias wad01 "nextmap megawads/doom2d.wad MAP01"
	alias wad02 "nextmap megawads/doom2d2.wad MAP01"
	alias wad03 "nextmap megawads/VETERAN.wad MAP01"
	alias wad04 "nextmap megawads/Bloodworks.wad MAP01"

	# Set aliases for right calling megawads
	alias coop01 "call wad01; event onwadend call coop02"
	alias coop02 "call wad02; event onwadend call coop03"
	alias coop03 "call wad03; event onwadend call coop04"
	alias coop04 "call wad04; event onwadend call coop01"
	@endpre

All aliases are invoked through commands:

callvote call <alias>
	For players
rcon call <alias>
	For administrator with rcon.

@h1 RECOMENDATIONS
At the moment, the use of custom configuration for servers, although preferable, also requires some additional commands to start the server correctly.

@h2 General
Between the aliases and the server configuration, set the following:

	@pre
	event oninter ""
	event onmapend call cmap01
	@endpre

Otherwise the server will not use the map list. In place of cmap01 you can specify what you used to name the aliases with maps.

@h2 Standart server (with DM or team gamemodes)
At the very end of the configuration, write for example:

	@pre
	map PrikolSoft.wad MAP01
	@endpre

Then we start it with the command:

	@pre
	$ Doom2DF_H -map PrikolSoft.wad:\\\MAP01 -gm DM -port 25667 -exec maplist_dm.txt --log-file dfserver_dm.log
	@endpre
	
So the server starts up and switches the map after a while after the start, applying all the necessary parameters and running the map call alias we set at the beginning.

@h2 Coop server
For a cooperative server, you can't prescribe any map calls at the end, otherwise it will be broken and you'll have to manually switch the map on the server.

The following command must be used to start it:

	@pre
	$ Doom2DF_H -map doom2d.wad:\\\MAP01 -gm COOP -port 25667 -exec coop_list.txt --log-file dfserver_coop.log
	@endpre

The map you can put what you want from the beginning of the server. This will ensure that the megawads are switched correctly. Also, do not use when testing the cooperative server command endmap - it will switch you to any map in the folder, but not the next megawad map!
